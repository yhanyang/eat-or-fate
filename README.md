# 🍽️ Eat or Fate

**When you're out with friends and no one wants to decide where to eat… Let fate decide for you!**


A simple restaurant picker for exactly those moments when:

👥 You're with a group of friends  
❓ Everyone's hungry but nobody wants to make the decision  
💬 The classic conversation happens:  
> *"Where should we eat?"*  
> *"Anything's fine."*  
> *"I don't care, you choose."*  
> *"No, you pick."*  

Just click the button — "fate" will decide for you.
